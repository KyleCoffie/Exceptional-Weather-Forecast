#Task 1: Keyword Highlighter

#Write a program that searches through reviews list and looks for keywords such as "good", "excellent", "bad", "poor", and "average".
#  We want you to capitalize those keywords then print out each review. Print out each review with the keywords in uppercase so they stand out.
reviews = [
    "This product is really good. I'm impressed with its quality.",
    "The performance of this product is excellent. Highly recommended!",
    "I had a bad experience with this product. It didn't meet my expectations.",
    "Poor quality product. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",
    "The product was average. Nothing extraordinary about it."
    ]
    #So for the first string in the reviews list, we want it to say: "This product is really GOOD. I'm impressed with its quality."
keywords = ["good", "excellent", "bad", "poor", "average"]

def capitalize_keywords(review, keywords):
    for keyword in keywords:
        review = review.replace(keyword, keyword.upper())
    return review

# Process each review
for review in reviews:
    updated_review = capitalize_keywords(review, keywords)
    print(updated_review)



#Task 2: Sentiment Tally

#Develop a function that tallies the number of positive and negative words in each review.  
# The function should return the total count of positive and negative words.

reviews = [
       "This product is really good. I'm impressed with its quality.",
        "The performance of this product is excellent. Highly recommended!",
        "I had a bad experience with this product. It didn't meet my expectations.",
        "Poor quality product. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",
        "The product was average. Nothing extraordinary about it."]

positive_words = ["good","impressed", "excellent","highly", "great", "awesome", "fantastic", "superb", "amazing"]
negative_words = ["bad", "poor", "terrible","average" "horrible", "awful", "disappointing", "subpar"]

if positive_words in reviews:
   word_count = len(positive_words)
   print (word_count)
    

#Task 3: Review Summary



#Implement a script that takes the first 30 characters of a review and appends "â€¦" to create a summary. 
# Ensure that the summary does not cut off in the middle of a word.

#Example: "This product is really good. I'm...",
def smart_truncate(content, length=30, suffix='...'):
  if len(content) <= length:
    return content
  else:
    return ' '.join(content[:length+1].split(' ')[0:-1]) + suffix
