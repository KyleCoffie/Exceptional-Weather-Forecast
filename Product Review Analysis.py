#Task 1: Keyword Highlighter

#Write a program that searches through reviews list and looks for keywords such as "good", "excellent", "bad", "poor", and "average".
#  We want you to capitalize those keywords then print out each review. Print out each review with the keywords in uppercase so they stand out.
reviews = [
    "This product is really good. I'm impressed with its quality.",
    "The performance of this product is excellent. Highly recommended!",
    "I had a bad experience with this product. It didn't meet my expectations.",
    "Poor quality product. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",
    "The product was average. Nothing extraordinary about it."

    #So for the first string in the reviews list, we want it to say: "This product is really GOOD. I'm impressed with its quality."
keywords = ["good", "excellent", "bad", "poor", "average"]

# Process each review
for review in reviews:

#Task 2: Sentiment Tally

#Develop a function that tallies the number of positive and negative words in each review.  
# The function should return the total count of positive and negative words.

reviews = [
       "This product is really good. I'm impressed with its quality.",
        "The performance of this product is excellent. Highly recommended!",

positive_total = 0
negative_total = 0
for review in reviews:
    
    for positive_word in positive_words:
        positive_word_count = review.lower().count(positive_word)
        positive_total += positive_word_count
    
    for negative_word in negative_words:

        negative_total += negative_word_count

#Task 3: Review Summary



#Implement a script that takes the first 30 characters of a review and appends "â€¦" to create a summary. 
# Ensure that the summary does not cut off in the middle of a word.

#Example: "This product is really good. I'm...",

    # If the review is less than 30 characters, add the original review to our reviews_to_return
